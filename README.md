# Data-Analysis-Projects
The Data Analysis Projects is a repository that houses a collection of my data analysis projects. Here, you will find the real-world data analysis projects that I have undertaken to demonstrate my skills, knowledge, and creativity in working with data.

This repository contains two distinct data analysis projects as of now, each focusing on different datasets and objectives. The projects are aimed at showcasing my skills in data analysis, from data preprocessing to exploratory analysis and visualization.

## Project 1: Amazon Data Science Books Data Analysis
* Description: I created this project as a course project for **Data Analysis with Python:Zero to Pandas** from https://jovian.com/. I was required to pick up any data set and conduct an analysis on it. I chose Amazon Data Science Books Data Analysis from Kaggle as I found it interesting and relevant to this field of study.
* Key Features: The key features of the project include data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis and data visualization for answering interesting questions about the data at the end
* Technologies Used: This project is created using Python and its libraries like NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib and Seaborn

## Project 2: Project Responses
* Description: This project was created using an excel file consisting of responses of a google form. This google form was created for students of my college "MSI/T" to register for contributing in the development of our app **Doubtless** which is now available on play store. As a member of the Data Team of the app, I was required to collect these responses and analyse the data regarding the domain the students want to contribute in, which year they are studying in, etc.
* Key Features: The key features of the project include data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis and data visualization for finding inferences about the data
* Technologies Used: This project is created using Python and its libraries like NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib and Seaborn

## Getting Started
* I have provided the Google Colaboratory link with each of the projects and you can navigate the project in Google Colab as well.
* You can also clone the repository using the git clone command.
